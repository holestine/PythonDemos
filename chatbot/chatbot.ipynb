    "ChatGPT and similar LLMs are trained on a very large corpus of data to enable basic knowledge in many domains. Generally their knowledge can be augmented with more current or more detailed data to extend their capabilities into other areas of expertise. The script [extract_training_data.py](./extract_training_data.py) collects data from a set of pre-specified web pages and local PDFs in order to create the data needed to do this then puts the text in the file [data.txt](./data.txt). It's worth noting that this example is text based but multimodal and layout aware capabilities are becoming more common and are available in [Cortex by SnowFlake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/data-cloud/cortex/)."
